Moxifloxacin is an a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, used to treat a variety of bacterial infactions ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). Moxifloxacin is administered typically with a 400 mg once daily regimen.

Moxifloxacin is absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract, with almost complete bioavailability (90 %) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](##main-references)). Plasma concentrations show dose-linear PK ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). The elimination half-life is 12h. Plasma protein binding is approximately 30-50 % ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). Moxifloxacin has a distribution volume ranging between 1.7-2.7 L/kg ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). About half of the dose is metabolized to inactive metabolites via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation, whereas about 20 % is found unchanged in urine and 25 % in feces ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for approximately 38 % of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). The glucuronide conjugate (M2) accounts for approximately 14 % of the dose, and is eliminated in the urine ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). 

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for Moxifloxacin in (healthy) adults. The model was developed using data of 3 clinical studies with intravenous and oral administration of 400 mg QD ([Sullivan 1999, Stass and Kabitza 1999, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2016](#main-references)). The model was evaluated using data of 3 clinical studies with intravenous and oral administration of doses ranging between 60 and 600 mg ([Siefert 1999, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2000 U.S](#main-references)). The PK-Sim project file contains simulations and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. 

The presented Moxifloxacin PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Moxifloxacin-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Moxifloxacin-Model)).
