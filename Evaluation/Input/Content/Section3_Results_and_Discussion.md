The PBPK model for moxifloxacin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* Intravenous and oral administration of 400 mg ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2000 U.S](#5-references))
* Intravenous and oral administration of 100 mg ([Siefert 1999](#5-references))
* Single oral administration of doses ranging between 60 and 600 mg ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2000 U.S](#5-references))

The model quantifies moxifloxacin metabolism via glucuronidation and sulfate conjugation, and elimination via renal and biliary clearance. The PBPK model shows good predictive performance after intravenous administration, and reasonable predictions for oral administration (GMFE < 2). The PBPK model shows some discrepancy in prediction of tmax compared to the  clinical data. This could be explained by the assumptions implemented for regarding the formulation and biliary clearance processes. Nevertheless a tmax closer to the model predictions (about 1-2h) is  reported in literature, suggesting that the discrepancy could be related to data extraction and/or secondary peaks ([Stass and Kabitza 1999, Siefert 1999, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2000](#main-references)). Furthermore, the PBPK model shows sensitivity to the gastrointestinal transit time, which could also explain the variability observed in clinical data. Gastrointestinal transit time has been shown to affect oral pharmacokinetics for several medicines ([Grimm 2018](#main-references)) Sullivan et al., 1999 contributed observed differences in accumulation ratio between studies to random variation associate with small sample sizes ([Sullivan 1999](#main-references)). Further model refinements could integrate *in vitro* data for the metabolism pathways, formulation characteristics and mechnistics behind interindividual variability. Nevertheless, this PBPK model can be applied to predict pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin after intravenous and oral administration.
