# Moxifloxacin-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of moxifloxacin. The aim of the current PBPK model development was to establish a PBPK model for moxifloxacin.


## Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of moxifloxacin. The model was developed using data of 3 clinical studies with intravenous and oral administration of 400 mg QD. The model was evaluated using data of 3 clinical studies with intravenous and oral administration of doses ranging between 60 and 600 mg. The PK-Sim project file contains simulations and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation.
